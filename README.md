# Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms used to approximate or simulate complex systems or processes through random sampling. These simulations are particularly useful when analytical or deterministic solutions are difficult or impractical to obtain.

In Monte Carlo simulations, random numbers are generated to represent uncertain or probabilistic variables in a system. These random values are then used to perform repeated calculations or iterations to estimate the behavior or outcome of the system. By running a large number of iterations, the simulation can provide statistical distributions, probabilities, or expected values of various quantities of interest.
